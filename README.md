# VetTech Academy Online Training App

This app was created as a project to demonstrate my skills in Vite React TS, AWS, and as a full stack developer. 

### The premise of this application is as follows: 

Problem: In most states a degree is required to be a veterinary technician, but not for a veterinary assistant. Most people tend not to go for a vet tech degree because the average salary of a vet tech does not justify the expense of getting the degree. Due to this shortage most vet clinics hire vet assistants. This causes an issue. A veterinarian, senior vet tech/asst., or management must teach these assistants everything needed to complete their work. Even vet techs need training if they are just starting out. This takes time and money from the clinic.

Solution: This application is an eLearning platform for veterinary technicians and assistants.  A clinic would reach out to VetTech Academy to sign up their clinic for this eLearning platform. VetTech Academy will provide user logins for each user and customize their learning requirements. This will ensure that all their technicians and assistance are well trained in order to excel at their work.
